line 27: price should throw an exception if it is <= 0 because nothing would be sold for $0



VendingMachine
---------------------------------------------
getBalance() does not try to throw any exceptions, it only returns whatever number it is given, does not check pre conditions
getItem() set up to throw an exception but does not have an if statement to check it -> this was removed
removeItem() needs to check if the code is invalid -> removed this
insertMoney() should throw an exception if the amount entered is <=0 because $0.00 cannot be entered
